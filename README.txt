For a brief overview of our project and individual contributions, check out our
presentation slides!

The folder 'Misc. Data Exploration' consists of some of the things we did which
we thought wouldn't fit the flow of the project, or didn't produce desirable
results. These include different methods of data cleaning as well as clustering 
and anomaly detection models. But we wanted to show our effort anyway!
